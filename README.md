replacement for original nerdtree fs menu

usage:

```
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'

Plug 'ZSaberLv0/nerdtree_fs_menu'
let g:loaded_nerdtree_exec_menuitem = 1
let g:loaded_nerdtree_fs_menu = 1

" recommended to install this too
Plug 'ZSaberLv0/nerdtree_menu_util'
```

why:

* the default fs menu has many useless item,
    which is easy to have key conflict with your own,
    and there's no way to disable it
